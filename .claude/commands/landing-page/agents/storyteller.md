## Problem Section

### The Scene
It's 8:47 PM. The dishes aren't done. You have three emails to send. And from the bedroom, you hear it again: "One more story, pleeeease!"

### The Narrative
You love your kids more than anything. But some nights, when you're running on four hours of sleep and have already read "Goodnight Moon" seventeen times this week, finding the energy for one more creative bedtime story feels impossible.

You try making one up. "Once upon a time there was a... um... princess who... lived in a castle..." Their eyes glaze over. They can tell your heart isn't in it. And the guilt settles in like a familiar weight.

### The Moment of Magic
What if there was a way to give them the most magical, personalized story they've ever heard—one where THEY are the hero—without you having to invent it from scratch every single night?

### Emotional Anchors
- Relief: Finally, help with the creative load
- Connection: Quality time without the pressure
- Wonder: See your child's face light up
