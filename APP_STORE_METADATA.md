### Notes for Reviewer
```
Thank you for reviewing InfiniteStories!

This app uses OpenAI's API to generate personalized children's stories and audio narration. During initial setup, users need to configure their OpenAI API key in Settings. We're actively developing a subscription model to remove this requirement.

Key Points:
1. All generated content is age-appropriate (filtered for children 3-12)
2. No user tracking or data collection beyond local story storage
3. Audio continues in background for bedtime use
4. Content is generated on-demand, not pre-stored
5. Parents have full control over story content and can edit before playing

To test the app:
1. Launch and tap "Get Started"
2. Go to Settings and enter an OpenAI API key (we can provide a test key if needed)
3. Create a hero character
4. Generate a story by selecting an event
5. Play the audio story

Please contact us if you need a test API key or have any questions: infinitestories.review@example.com
