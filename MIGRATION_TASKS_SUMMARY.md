---

## Task Priority Breakdown

- **Critical Priority**: ~60 tasks (68%)
- **High Priority**: ~23 tasks (26%)
- **Medium Priority**: ~5 tasks (6%)

Critical tasks must be completed before moving forward. High priority tasks are important but have some flexibility. Medium priority tasks are nice-to-have or documentation-related.

---

## Agent Distribution

Based on the comprehensive analysis by specialized agents:

### iOS Engineer
- Phase 1: Service protocol creation (5 tasks)
- Phase 2: Firebase service implementation (17 tasks)
- Phase 3: Model updates (5 tasks)
- Phase 4: iOS integration (12 tasks)
- **Total**: ~39 tasks

### Firebase Engineer
- Phase 1: Backend setup (9 tasks)
- Phase 3: Data migration scripts (5 tasks)
- **Total**: ~14 tasks

### QA/Test Automation Engineer
- Phase 5: All testing tasks (13 tasks)
- **Total**: ~13 tasks

### DevOps Engineer
- Phase 6: Deployment and monitoring (14 tasks)
- **Total**: ~14 tasks

### Additional Support
- **Senior Software Architect**: Architecture reviews, risk assessment
- **Security Engineer**: Security rules validation
- **Product Manager**: UAT coordination, rollout decisions

---

## Critical Path

The critical path runs through these essential tasks:

1. **Week 1**: Create protocols → Firebase config → Deploy backend
2. **Week 2**: Implement Firebase services → Update AIServiceFactory
3. **Week 3**: Update models → Data migration (if needed)
4. **Week 4**: Update ViewModels → Remove Supabase
5. **Week 5**: All tests passing
6. **Week 6**: Deploy to production

**Estimated minimum duration**: 6 weeks (following the critical path with no delays)

---

## Key Dependencies

### Phase Dependencies
- Phase 2 depends on Phase 1 (protocols and backend setup)
- Phase 3 can partially overlap with Phase 2
- Phase 4 depends on Phase 2 and 3
- Phase 5 depends on Phase 4
- Phase 6 depends on Phase 5 (all tests passing)

### Critical Blockers
- Firebase backend must be deployed before iOS integration
- All tests must pass before production deployment
- Data migration must complete before removing Supabase

## Implementation Strategy

### Recommended Approach

1. **Parallel Tracks (Week 1)**
   - iOS engineer: Create protocols + config
   - Backend engineer: Deploy Firebase infrastructure
   - Merge point: Both complete before Week 2

2. **Sequential Implementation (Weeks 2-4)**
   - Week 2: Implement all services
   - Week 3: Update models (can start in parallel with late Week 2)
   - Week 4: iOS integration and cleanup

3. **Validation (Week 5)**
   - Run all test suites
   - Fix any issues discovered
   - UAT with beta testers

4. **Deployment (Week 6)**
   - Phased rollout with monitoring
   - Quick rollback capability maintained

### Success Criteria

- ✅ All 88 tasks completed
- ✅ No Supabase code remaining
- ✅ All tests passing (>80% coverage)
- ✅ Production deployment successful
- ✅ User retention maintained (>95%)
- ✅ No critical bugs in production

---

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas

1. **Data Migration** (Phase 3)
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing on staging data
   - Backup: Keep Supabase running as fallback

2. **Authentication Migration** (Phase 2)
   - Mitigation: Support dual auth during transition
   - Backup: Maintain Supabase auth temporarily

3. **Performance Degradation** (Phase 5)
   - Mitigation: Benchmark early and often
   - Backup: Performance budgets and monitoring

### Rollback Plan

At any point, if critical issues occur:
1. Pause iOS app rollout in App Store Connect
2. Revert to previous app version if needed
3. Maintain Supabase backend as fallback
4. Investigate and fix issues
5. Resume migration when ready

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review this breakdown** with the team
2. **Assign agents** to tasks using the PRD tool
3. **Set up PRD dashboard** for progress tracking
4. **Begin Phase 1** implementation
5. **Daily standups** using PRD stats

### Starting Phase 1

```bash
# Assign iOS engineer to protocol tasks
./target/release/prd assign <task-id> ios-engineer

# Mark task as in progress
./target/release/prd update <task-id> in_progress

# Complete task
./target/release/prd update <task-id> completed
```

---

## Agent Coordination

The PRD tool enables multi-agent coordination:

```rust
// Agent registration
let client = PRDClient::new("tools/prd.db")?;
client.create_agent("ios-engineer".to_string())?;

// Get next task
let task = client.get_next_task(Some(Priority::High))?;
client.sync_agent("ios-engineer", &task.id)?;

// Complete task
client.complete_task(&task.id, "ios-engineer")?;
```

See `tools/prd/examples/` for complete agent integration examples.
