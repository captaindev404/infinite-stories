import SwiftUI

// MARK: - Migration Steps
/*
 To migrate from the original StoryLibraryView to the ImprovedStoryLibraryView:
 
 1. In ContentView.swift, update the NavigationLink:
    
    OLD:
    NavigationLink("View Story Library (\(stories.count))") {
        StoryLibraryView()
    }
    
    NEW:
    NavigationLink("View Story Library (\(stories.count))") {
        ImprovedStoryLibraryView()
    }
 
 2. The ImprovedStoryLibraryView is fully backward compatible and uses the same
    Story model and AudioPlayerView for playback.
 
 3. No changes needed to the Story model or database schema.
 
 4. Optional: Add these properties to Story model for enhanced features:
    - lastPlayedAt: Date? (for resume functionality)
    - progress: Double (0.0 to 1.0 for partial completion)
    - tags: [String] (for additional categorization)

// MARK: - Feature Comparison
struct FeatureComparison {
    /*
     Original StoryLibraryView:
     - Simple List view
     - Basic row layout
     - Minimal visual hierarchy
     - Text-only metadata
     - Single tap interaction
     
     ImprovedStoryLibraryView:
     + Card-based design with shadows
     + Visual status indicators (New, In Progress, Completed)
     + Search functionality
     + Filter pills (All, New, Favorites, Recent)
     + Progress bars for in-progress stories
     + Smart date formatting
     + Event-specific icons and colors
     + Context menu with quick actions
     + Haptic feedback
     + Stats dashboard
     + Gradient backgrounds
     + Animated interactions
     + Empty state design
     + Better typography hierarchy
     + Consistent spacing system
     */
}

// MARK: - Code Examples

// Example 1: Using the improved view
struct ContentViewExample: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            VStack {
                // Your existing content...
                
                NavigationLink("View Story Library") {
                    // Simply replace StoryLibraryView with ImprovedStoryLibraryView
                    ImprovedStoryLibraryView()
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

// Example 2: Customizing colors for your brand
extension StoryLibraryDesign.Colors {
    // Override default colors if needed
    static let customPrimary = Color("YourBrandColor")
    static let customAccent = Color("YourAccentColor")
}

// Example 3: Adding custom story categories
extension StoryEvent {
    var customIcon: String {
        // Add your custom icon mapping
        switch self {
        case .bedtime: return "custom.bedtime.icon"
        default: return "sparkles"
        }
    }
}

// MARK: - Performance Considerations
struct PerformanceNotes {
    /*
     The ImprovedStoryLibraryView includes several performance optimizations:
     
     1. LazyVStack instead of List for better scrolling performance
     2. Cached color definitions to avoid recreation
     3. Optimized shadow rendering
     4. Conditional rendering of progress bars
     5. Smart date caching to reduce formatter calls
     
     For libraries with 100+ stories, consider:
     - Implementing pagination
     - Adding a "Load More" button
     - Using background queues for search
     - Caching thumbnail images
     */
}

// MARK: - Customization Options
struct CustomizationGuide {
    /*
     The ImprovedStoryLibraryView can be customized:
     
     1. Colors: Modify StoryLibraryDesign.Colors
     2. Typography: Adjust StoryLibraryDesign.Typography
     3. Spacing: Change StoryLibraryDesign.Spacing values
     4. Animations: Modify spring parameters
     5. Card Style: Adjust corner radius and shadows
     6. Filters: Add custom filter options in StoryFilter enum
     7. Status Logic: Modify story status calculation
     8. Icons: Change event icon mapping
     
     All design tokens are centralized in the StoryLibraryDesign struct
     for easy customization.
     */
}

// MARK: - Rollback Plan
struct RollbackInstructions {
    /*
     If you need to rollback to the original design:
     
     1. Change NavigationLink back to use StoryLibraryView()
     2. The original StoryLibraryView is preserved and unchanged
     3. No data migration needed - both views use the same Story model
     4. Delete the three new files if desired:
        - ImprovedStoryLibraryView.swift
        - StoryLibraryDesignGuide.swift
        - MigrationGuide.swift
     
     The improved design is completely additive and doesn't modify
     any existing code, making rollback simple and safe.
