## Problem Section

### The Scene
It's 8:47 PM. The dishes are finally done. Your back aches from carrying groceries, answering emails, mediating sibling disputes. You climb the stairs to your daughter's room, where she's bouncing on the bed, wide awake, clutching her favorite stuffed elephant. "Story time!" she squeals. And your heart sinks—because you love her more than anything, but right now, you have nothing left to give. You reach for the same book you've read forty-three times. She sighs. You sigh louder.

### Pain Points
- **The Guilt**: The guilt gnaws at you in quiet moments: *I should treasure these years. They're so short. Why can't I be more present?* But presence requires energy you spent hours ago, somewhere between the third Zoom call and the tantrum at Target.

- **The Disconnect**: You watch her eyes when you read—really watch them—and you see the exact moment she checks out. She knows what's coming. There's no magic anymore, just routine. And you wonder: *When did bedtime stories become a chore instead of a gift?*

- **The Rushing**: Some nights, you catch yourself rushing through pages, skipping paragraphs, praying she doesn't notice. She always notices. "You missed the part about the bunny, Mommy." And the shame settles in your chest like a stone.

## Solution Section

### The Discovery Moment
One night, scrolling through your phone while she brushes her teeth, you find it. A story app—but different. This one puts *your child* in the adventure. You type in her name, her brown curls, her obsession with horses and space. You press generate. And then you hear it: "Once upon a time, a brave girl named Lily with curly brown hair and a heart as big as the moon, climbed aboard her rocket-powered horse..."

### The Transformation
Her toothbrush clatters to the floor. She runs to you, eyes wide as planets. "That's ME! Mommy, that's ME!" For the first time in months, she *asks* to go to bed. She wants to know what Lily does next. She wants to be the hero.

### The Emotional Payoff
You're no longer performing bedtime. You're experiencing it together—both of you leaning in, both of you surprised by what comes next. When the story ends and she wraps her arms around your neck, she whispers, "I love being brave like Lily." And you realize: this is the memory you both will keep.

## Social Proof Section

### Testimonials

**Marcus, Single Dad (Son, Age 5)**
> "I'm a single dad. By bedtime, I'm running on empty. The first night I played an InfiniteStories adventure with my son as a dragon-taming knight, he looked at me like I'd given him the moon. Now he tells his kindergarten class about his 'adventures.' I gave him something I didn't know I had left to give."

**Priya, Mom of 7-Year-Old**
> "My daughter was starting to say she was 'too old' for stories. I was heartbroken—I wasn't ready to lose that time with her. Then we tried a mystery adventure with her as the detective. She grabbed my hand during the suspenseful part. She's not too old. She just needed a story worthy of who she's becoming."

**Elena, Mom of 3-Year-Old**
> "My son has a speech delay. Most books move too fast for him. But hearing a gentle voice say HIS name, describe HIS red sneakers, HIS love of dinosaurs—he lit up. He pointed at the screen and said 'Me! Me!' It was one of his clearest words that month."
