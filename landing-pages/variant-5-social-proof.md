## Featured Testimonials Section

### Section Headline
Real Stories from Real Families

**Featured Review #1**
> "I'm a pediatrician. I'm cautious about screens, especially before bed. But InfiniteStories is audio-first with optional visuals, child-safe by design, and it actually winds my son down instead of ramping him up. From a professional and a parent perspective, this is how children's technology should work."
>
> **— Linda, Pediatrician, Mom of 5-Year-Old**
> ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Featured Review #2**
> "I have twins. Different personalities, different interests, different bedtime struggles. InfiniteStories lets me create separate heroes for each. For the first time, they're not fighting over whose story gets told. They each get their own adventure. They're actually *excited* to split up for bed."
>
> **— Marcus, Dad of Twin 6-Year-Olds**
> ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Featured Review #3**
> "My husband travels for work constantly. Bedtime when he's gone was always a battle—our daughter missed him too much. Now she has an InfiniteStories hero, and when Daddy's away, her hero goes on adventures to find things to tell Daddy about. It bridged something I couldn't bridge alone."
>
> **— Jennifer, Mom of 4-Year-Old**
> ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Featured Review #4**
> "English is my second language. Reading aloud in English always made me self-conscious—my accent, my pacing. InfiniteStories lets me be present without performing. The AI narrates beautifully. My job is just to be there. To hold her. That's enough now."
>
> **— Wei, Mom of 3-Year-Old**
> ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Featured Review #5**
> "My son has ADHD. Traditional audiobooks lose him in seconds. But when HE is the character? When the story says his name and describes his favorite things? He locks in. His therapist asked what changed at bedtime. InfiniteStories changed. That's what changed."
>
> **— Daniel, Dad of 7-Year-Old**
> ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
